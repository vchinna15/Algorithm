# Algorithm
Algorithm is a step-by-step instructions to solve a problem

Evaluate an algorithm based on:
1. Correctness ( Finite number of steps to solve the problem)
2. Efficiency ( Time and Space it takes to execute the steps)

Analysis of Algorithm is done to compare two algorithms in terms of runnimg time and memory resources it consumes.

How to compare algorithms:
Execution times: Not a good measure as execution times are specific to a particular computer.
Number of statements executed: Not a good measure, since the number of statements varies
with the programming language as well as the style of the individual programmer.
Ideal solution: Let us assume that we express the running time of a given algorithm as a function
of the input size n (i.e., f(n)) and compare these different functions corresponding to running
times. This kind of comparison is independent of machine time, programming style, etc.

Rate of Growth: The rate at which the running time increases as a function of input is called rate of growth.

Types of Analysis (Worst Case, Best Case, Average Case Analysis):
To analyze the given algorithm, we need to know with which inputs the algorithm takes less time
(performing well) and with which inputs the algorithm takes a long time. We have already seen
that an algorithm can be represented in the form of an expression. That means we represent the
algorithm with multiple expressions: one for the case where it takes less time and another for the
case where it takes more time.
In general, the first case is called the best case and the second case is called the worst case for
the algorithm.
