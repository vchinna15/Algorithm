# Algorithm
Algorithm is a step-by-step instructions to solve a problem

Evaluate an algorithm based on:
1. Correctness ( Finite number of steps to solve the problem)
2. Efficiency ( Time and Space it takes to execute the steps)

Analysis of Algorithm is done to find efficient algorithm in terms of runnimg time and memory resources it consumes.
